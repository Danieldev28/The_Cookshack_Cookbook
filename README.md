# Daniel Smith Portfolio 

Welcome to my portfolio Data Centric Development application! 
Hello, My name is Daniel and through this project I am excited present to you yet 
another in a series of web applications on my journey through Full-Stack web development.

# Technologies

1.HTML
2.CSS
3.Bootstrap v4.3.2
4.Javascript
5.Fontawsome
6.Jquery library
7.Python
8.Full Stack Micro Framework Flask
9.MySQL relational database management system 
9.MySQL Workbench (External server RBMS)

# Features
This is a web application that allows users to store and easily 
access cooking recipes. It is a full stack web application (frontend and backend) 
that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to a database 
hosted in the cloud and uses Heroku platform as a hosting server. 
It features a very simple design with a navigation menu along the top right.
It contains a simple yet attractive homepage with only two navigation buttons.Those 
being home and add a recipe page. A big carousel display welcomes you to the webpage, 
followed by a plethora of choices of recipes to choose from which give the user 
recipe ideas to cook from. It also features a second form submission page which 
the user can interact and input thier own recipes, building the cookshack community.

Users can:
Add Recipe: There is a user form which you can submit your recipes, aswell as an 
image for the recipe sharing community
Manage Categories: Choose from which category they would like to create a recipe
and also choose one to cook based on the cards having simple identification 
features
Recipe Detail: Once a recipe is clicked it displays the full recipe and instructions
to the user for easy use of the information given
Featured Desserts: View featured desserts in the dessert section at the bootom of 
the home page

### Demo
A demo of this web application is available here.

## Features Left To Implement

The features which I would like to implement, would be to add a most recent 
recipes by time and date feature. Along with a short star rating review and comment
by previous users, this would introduce the user to trusted ratings by their peers 
and friends on the webpage. Secondly I would like to add a search bar that was 
functional; due to time and project restrtricions in the techology stacks we were 
able to use, I was unable to implement this feuture to full affect. Rather it is
there as a dummy button. Which shows the websites future potential for modification 
and updates. A most popular recipe section on the form page displaying three of the 
top rated recipes.Finally to add a small logo which represents the company cookshack.



# UX

My goal with ux design was to make sure that my application was as user friendly 
and easy to navigate as possible. I strived to make a user interface would readable
yet attractive and functional at the same time.


# Testing
Intial testing of the game as an app was very successful
This project was tested on several virtual devices through the use of page 
inspection. I have tested nagivation buttons and hyperllinks which are in various 
places on the page. Some of the trials I encountered while testing and updating, 
were ranging from the very basic to difficult. During testing implementing changes 
to mySQL database seemed to be very difficult, but as time went on, it became 
much easier to handle the syntax and create my relational database. Also handling 
routing in python was somtimes tricky due to running on flask framework which
kept throwing errors, which I was able to solve with help during the development
process. I was also able to test the CRUD functions create,update,read,delete 
while creating a relational database.

# Credits 
I would like to credit numerous cites for inspiration in ux design as I could 
not have done this with inspiration and at times a little persperation. Cites 
used for application inspiration <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com">here.</a> 
I would also like to credit the stackoverflow community for any methods and 
code snippets used, it was a really awesome resource to roll up my sleeves and 
learn on the website.

# Media 

Any media you see inside this web application was created by yours truly
a.k.a me. Fonts were borrowed and inspired by varies webpages.
Most Images were taken from tasty.com website.
Many challenges were faced during the creation of this application, but I learned
that there is almost always a solotion for everything, and as they say the more 
you know the less you feel like you know. So it is best for me to keep learning 
and striving to become the best developer I can be.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the use of bootstrap components. As well as 
w3schools.com for when I got stuck. I also searched stackoverflow.com countless
times for more information to solve problems with my application when I was stuck 
on the harder portions. I am thankful that my project is finally exactly as I  
had envsioned.  Thank you for viewing this presentation of my 
Data Centric Development project and hope to 
present to you many in the future.Until then that wraps up my skills as 
as a brand new Full-Stack web developer.
